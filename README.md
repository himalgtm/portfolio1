## What this is

A single-page portfolio that:

- tells my story as a CS + GIS student at UNT  
- shows the projects I’m actually proud of  
- links to my résumé and ways to reach me  

No framework circus. Just HTML, utility-style CSS classes, and a bit of JavaScript.

---

## Tech (very small stack)

- HTML5  
- Utility-first CSS (Tailwind-style classes)  
- Vanilla JS for small interactions  
- GitHub Pages + custom domain (`himal.app`)

That’s it.

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/himalgtm/portfolio1.git
cd portfolio1
# option 1: just open index.html in a browser
# option 2: tiny local server
python -m http.server 8000
# then go to http://localhost:8000
